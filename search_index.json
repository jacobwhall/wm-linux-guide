[["index.html", "W&amp;M Linux User’s Survival Guide Chapter 1 About", " W&amp;M Linux User’s Survival Guide Jacob Hall Chapter 1 About In my years at William &amp; Mary, it has often been difficult to feel welcome as a Linux user. It is often assumed that all students will be using Windows or MacOS on their laptops, and there are few resources for *nix users. I believe that it’s important to use free and open source software whenever possible, and to help build a world in which others feel more comfortable doing the same. This guide is a growing collection of tips, tutorials, and rants about using Linux on campus. While I personally use the Debian and Fedora distributions of Linux, I hope this guide will help any students that use *nix flavoured operating systems.
