# W&M Linux User's Survival Guide

[READ IT HERE](https://jacobwhall.github.io/wm-linux-guide/)

This is a guide for students at William & Mary who use *nix as their primary operating system.
As a student who exclusively used Linux, there has been a lot of work involved with getting my technological needs met at this school.
This guide is meant to be a reference for myself, and I hope future students find it useful as well.

This repository is a self-building, self-publishing [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) book.
