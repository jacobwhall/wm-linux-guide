# About

In my years at William & Mary, it has often been difficult to feel welcome as a Linux user.
It is often assumed that all students will be using Windows or MacOS on their laptops, and there are few resources for *nix users.
I believe that it's important to use free and open source software whenever possible, and to help build a world in which others feel more comfortable doing the same.

This guide is a growing collection of tips, tutorials, and rants about using Linux on campus.
While I personally use the Debian and Fedora distributions of Linux, I hope this guide will help any students that use *nix flavoured operating systems.
